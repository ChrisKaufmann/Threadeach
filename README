Threadeach.pm - a perl module for easy threading of processes.

use instead of foreach and it will run (num of cpus) threads over the array and return.

ex:
my @a=(1,2,3,4,5);
threadeach my $b(@a)
{
	print "$b";
}

will print 12345 (but not necessarily in that order).

threadall will run as many threads as there are elements in the array.

threadx is a special case, and will run as many as follow the threadx

threadx20 my $c('A'..'Z')
{
	print "$c";
}

will run 20 threads at a time.
